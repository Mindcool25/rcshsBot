# THIS IS THE OFFICIAL BOT OF r/CSHIGHSCHOOLERS. 
# If you have an idea for the bot, you're supposed to be editing this file.
# Write REALLY neat code and don't mess with the main.py file in the repository. 
# Also don't mess with the commands you DON'T want to edit. 
# Make sure your code is neat and understandable so it can be checked and your feature will be up in NO TIME!
# If you feel like your command is better suited for another file or plan on making a series of similar/connected commands, making a new cog file like this one would be preferrable. Make sure you read the comments on this file to understand how to make your own.
# Thank you for contributing!
